# Staff Timesheet Portal

## About the project
This individual college project builds a simple platform for staff members to input their work hours and display the timesheet records.  

As validation, the employee number and email address must match with the records in the employee_info table.  

*Note:* Please update the credentials on database.php where necessary. The one used to connect to localhost in this project is **username:** root and **password:** password .  

## Languages / frameworks
PHP for connecting to the mysql database  

Bootstrap 3 for frontend styling (with customized css)  

## Future enhancements
Include a login system such that the timesheet records should be accessible by logged-in users only.  

Display timesheet details in multiple pages when there are more records, and potentially include a search/filter function to display selected timesheet entries (e.g. on a specific day, of a specific dept).  

More stylistic enhancements to improve the overall design.
